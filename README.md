# The Improved Models Patch

![Logo](http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/aetMRPVEDnE3u3qmEA3_n1pp9RsZJ84-u_C9uWBaW6E.png)

I had a while ago the idea of porting some Cataclysm m2s in WoW Classic. I first converted the models with tools found on Modcraft and fixed little things like textures to fit the 1.12 lighting system. 
A year ago I started my own tool to [convert M2 models](http://github.com/Koward/jM2converter) in Java, allowing me to go further in the process.
Now the models come from all extensions, even from Legion Beta.
I hope you'll enjoy it ;)
